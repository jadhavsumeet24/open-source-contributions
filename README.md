Hi there! 👋  
This repository tracks my open-source contributions across various public GitHub projects as I grow in my software development journey.

I'm actively contributing to beginner-friendly and impactful repositories to learn, share, and collaborate.  
This repo serves as a transparent record of my pull requests, the projects I’ve helped, and my learning path.

## 📌 Note

This GitHub account and contribution tracker were freshly created in July 2025 to focus specifically on public open-source projects.  
While I’ve worked on several personal and academic projects in the past (e.g. E-Commerce platform using Java Servlets, AI-based tumor classification), this marks the beginning of my journey into open collaboration and open-source contributions.
